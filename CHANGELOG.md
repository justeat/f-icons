v2.0.1
------------------------------
*June 25, 2020*

### Changed

v2.0.0
------------------------------
*June 19, 2020*

v2 Release! This converts `f-icons` into more of a library and API than what v1 was (see documentation for usage details).

These changes mean that we can build on top of this package to build framework specific iconsets such as `f-vue-icons` which use this API to pull in the icons and convert them into SFCs that can be fully tree-shaken as part of a build.

Also there are no more styles that come down as part of the `f-icons` package. The idea now is that the majority of icons exported are colour and size agnostic so that when pulled into a platform, they can be set to whatever values you like.

This restructuring has taken massive inspiration from the [Feather SVG icon library](https://github.com/feathericons/feather), including their API and build methods which are run on top of our icon-set.

### Changed
- **Breaking** â€“ Updating from `v1` of `f-icons` may not be trivial in all instances. It's recommended that you only do so if absolutely needed (as you will lose the styling that comes for free in `v1`). We recommend upgrading to `v2` as part of a migration to using `f-vue-icons` which has ben developed alongside this package. For platforms still using `v1`, that branch will still be supported should additional icons need to be added before upgrading to `v2` is practical.
- Complete restructuring of how the icons are structured in the repo and exported (as detailed above).
- Logo's updated to new JET branding (and names normalised)
- Normalised star icons down to `star-filled` and `star-empty` (as additional colours can be implemented using SVG `fill`).

v2.0.0-beta.2
------------------------------
*August 28, 2019*

### Added
- Viewbox attribute added so that the standard viewbox size set on the SVG isn't lost in the API calls


v2.0.0-beta.1
------------------------------
*August 22, 2019*

### Changed
- Complete restructuring of how the icons are structured in the repo and exported.
  This is so that when the module is exported, icons can be included in a variety of different ways for client side or server side includes.  The main thing this will give us is that the icons can then be exposed for use in Vue/React projects more effectively via a helper module.

  This restructuring has taken massive inspiration from the [Feather SVG icon library](https://github.com/feathericons/feather), including their API and build methods which are run on top of our icon-set.
